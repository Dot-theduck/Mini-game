    question: "What is the SI unit of force?",
    options: ["Joule", "Newton", "Pascal", "Watt"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The Newton (N) is the SI unit of force, defined as the force needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at 1 meter per second squared."

    question: "Which law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed?",
    options: ["Zeroth Law", "First Law", "Second Law", "Third Law"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The First Law of Thermodynamics is the law of conservation of energy, stating that energy can neither be created nor destroyed."

    question: "What is the phenomenon called when light changes direction as it passes from one medium to another?",
    options: ["Reflection", "Refraction", "Diffraction", "Interference"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Refraction occurs when light changes speed and direction as it passes from one medium to another due to the change in the medium's refractive index."

    question: "According to Coulomb's law, how does the electrostatic force between two charges vary with distance?",
    options: ["Directly proportional", "Inversely proportional", "Inversely proportional to square", "Directly proportional to square"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Coulomb's law states that the electrostatic force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the charges (1/r²)."

    question: "What is the primary difference between longitudinal and transverse waves?",
    options: [
      "Direction of propagation",
      "Direction of particle motion",
      "Wave speed",
      "Wavelength"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The main difference is in the direction of particle motion relative to wave propagation. In longitudinal waves, particles move parallel to wave direction; in transverse waves, perpendicular."

    question: "Which quantum number determines the shape of an electron orbital?",
    options: ["Principal", "Angular momentum", "Magnetic", "Spin"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The angular momentum quantum number (l) determines the shape of an electron orbital in an atom."

    question: "What is the equivalent resistance of two 4Ω resistors connected in parallel?",
    options: ["8Ω", "4Ω", "2Ω", "1Ω"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "For resistors in parallel, 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2. With two equal resistors, the equivalent resistance is half of the individual resistance."

    question: "According to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, what is the energy of 1kg of matter?",
    options: ["3 × 10⁸ J", "9 × 10¹⁶ J", "3 × 10¹⁶ J", "9 × 10⁸ J"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Using E = mc², where c = 3 × 10⁸ m/s, 1kg of matter equals 9 × 10¹⁶ joules of energy."

    question: "What is the period of a simple pendulum that is 1 meter long on Earth (g ≈ 9.8 m/s²)?",
    options: ["1 second", "2 seconds", "3 seconds", "4 seconds"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The period of a simple pendulum is T = 2π√(L/g). With L = 1m and g = 9.8 m/s², T ≈ 2 seconds."
